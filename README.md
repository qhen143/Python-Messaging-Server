Steps to run the client:
1. Install python 2.7.x if not already installed (Most Linux OS have python pre-installed)
2. Find mainApp.py (Default /src directory)
3. Check cherrypy package folder in the same directory as mainApp.py (Otherwise download a copy from Canvas)
4. Right click on a blank space in the /src directory and click "open in terminal"
5. Run the server by typing "python mainApp.py"
6. Open the link the engine is serving on (Default: http://0.0.0.0:1000)
